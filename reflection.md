Over the course of this project I've learned a lot about conceptualizing what we want to portray on the screen. This may seem abstract, but it's true. In order to create some of these fitlers, I made concept maps and diagrams to picture how I want to incorporate weighted percentages with original and new filters. Over the cours eof this project, i used alot of functions in which the the code for each filter is in. Additionally, I used for loops to show which part of the screent the filter would be applied. For example, I used the image parameters to portray that the filter should only apply to the width and height of the image.I also used variables to rperesent original pixel/original filter and the new filter. Over the course of this school year, I've learned to hone in my skills for organization; I made changes organizing my code, so its easy to read and review over when I'm debugging. I also added a flipImageDistorted filter which gives the user a distorted feeling when using the filter.
